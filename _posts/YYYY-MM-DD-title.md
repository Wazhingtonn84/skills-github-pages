## Gists, Wikis, and GitHub Pages
### Gists
Gists are simple ways to share snippets of code or text with others. They can be public or secret and support versioning.

### Wikis
Wikis provide a space for project documentation within a repository. They are collaborative and support Markdown for formatting.

### GitHub Pages
GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files from a repository and publishes them as a website.
